This archive includes the updated tables for DX Atlas (http://www.dxatlas.com).
To apply the update, unzip all files to the folder where DX Atlas is installed.

Prefix.lst is also used in HamCap,  BandMaster, DX Bulletin Reader, and some
other software. If you have one of these programs installed, make a second copy
of the Prefix.lst file and place it in this folder:

C:\Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Afreet\Reference\

where <user name> is your user name in Windows. Note that on some systems
the Application Data folder is marked as hidden in File Explorer. You have
to either type in the path to this folder, or enable the "Show hidden files and
folders" option in Windows.
