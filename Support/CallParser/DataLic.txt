Prefix Database (PREFIX.LST) was compiled from many sources
publicly available on the Internet. The Source column in this
file indicates where each piece of data came from. The sources
are listed in the PrefSrc.txt file.

We put this database in the public domain. You may use it 
for any commercial or non-commercial purpose in the modified 
or non-modified form, provided that: 1) the source of the 
original dataset is clearly indicated, and 2) all derivative 
products are also released as public domain data.
